# CP1404 Practicals

This GitHub repository contains my Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404, following the directions provided at the [CP1404
Practicals instructions repo](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).

## 'Clean code' lessons

CP1404 has taught me some important lessons about 'clean code', including these:

* Docstrings are required for file headers and for each function, and should be written in the imperative voice.
* A program should normally contain a main() function which calls (sub-)functions that each do one thing ("This
  function will...").
* Names for objects and functions should be descriptive, easy to read, and unambiguous; it is better for a name to be
  longer than
  abbreviated.
* Code should follow established methods, including those summarised in
  CP1404's [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) guide.
