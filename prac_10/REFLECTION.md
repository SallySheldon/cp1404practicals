# CP1404: Reflections...

## Estimates?
I found it challenging to estimate time required to complete coding exercises throughout the subject. In the first 
place, I tend to be a chronic underestimator of the time required to do most tasks. In addition, I found with CP1404 
that I often would not fully appreciate the amount of work and nature of work required by an exercise, 
until I worked my 
way into it. I got better at this as the subject progressed, and in particular in appreciating that around a 
third of time is required for planning, a third for coding, and a third for testing, for each exercise. But I now 
think that should be revised to 25% planning, 25% coding, 25% testing, and 25% dealing with unexpected thorny 
problems! I still 
find it impossible to predict where and when I will hit 'snags': thorny coding problems that I seem to take a lot of 
time to resolve - like how to get the band.py class definition methods working, in Prac 9. I spent what felt like 
ages on that... I suspect this is all a matter of fluency, and getting more experienced, and familiar with coding 
syntax, recalling where and how we've done things before, etc., as time goes on.

## Code reviews?
At a general level, doing reviews has improved my fluency in reading other people's code - in effect, I'm 
reading code more 'naturally'. The flip side of 
that is that it's 
made me more aware of what my code is likely to look like, when read by other eyes. It's the programming 
equivalent of reading more, and editing other people's writing,
to become a better writer. 

More specifically, doing code reviews has made me better at identifying, and being able to talk explicitly about, 
the 'grammar' of coding: why a particular syntax and/or method for handling a problem works, or doesn't, or even if 
it works, might not be the most efficient or optimal "tool for the job". It definitely consolidated the learning from 
lectures and pracs, because I had to talk about what I learned, in an applied context, and do that 
succinctly and constructively.

Two of the code reviews where I feel I had a good opportunity to do this (because the PR's were timely and high 
quality, so gave me a lot to work with) were:
* [My comments on Alex's Prac 06 code](https://github.com/alexdamrow/cp1404practicals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-1531657316), and
* [My comments on Brent's Prac 07 code](https://github.com/BrentB01/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-1548850965).

Overall, the process has demonstrated to me the importance of being clear and transparent in my coding, and the 
benefits involved in thinking of coding as a team exercise. There's increased accountability, when we look at our 
work as something that we're going to be handing to another person, to pick and up work with, in turn. (Which is, of 
course, how the 'real world' works!) 

## Practical tasks overall?
I think the Practical tasks are very well structured, to complement the subject content and consolidate learning. 
The use of GitHub is invaluable on many levels: teaching good practice for quality control, teaching an important 
skill, supporting the PR and code reviews, etc. I can only imagine how long it has taken, to build, and 
incrementally improve, the Practical 
task library and supporting materials for this subject to the level it's currently at - it's clearly been a 
sustained effort, and the benefit shows.

I honestly can't think of anything I'd change in terms of Practical task **content** if I were (_per impossibile_) in 
charge of the subject. I appreciate the way Pracs are modularised, broken up into tasks of increasing complexity, 
with optional content flagged as such, but provided for those who can get to it, etc. 

The only thing 
I'd note is 
that, because there is such a lot of detailed content 
in each 
Prac - in the instructions, the examples provided, etc - I think it can be challenging for the subject 
coordinator to appreciate just how hard it can be for students to assimilate all that content and act on it, in the 
time available. I think most of us 
genuinely work incredibly hard, and try our darndest, to do the right thing... but we are finite, human, and will 
and do miss things, and it's not - always, or even mostly - due to laziness, or not being careful. It's 
genuinely 
almost impossible to get through the content for four subjects, simultaneously, in a full-time degree program. I
simply couldn't get through the core content for CP1404, to a high standard, in under 10-12 hours a week, on average 
(it would take me 5-6 hours to work through the lectures and seminar content carefully, coding to practise, 
screenshotting and/or 
printing code for notes, taking short breaks, etc; and then it would take me about the same time to do the prac 
activities, including code reviews, well) - 
and that's without even tackling extension activities. The 
same holds for my other three subjects... so that's 45-50 hours of week, of core working time, without factoring in 
time for major assessment pieces (additional workload)... and then there is life... :-)  

The most valuable part, for me, in addition to the *active* learning, has been documenting what I've learned, in a 
logical way, 
so I 
can 
go back to it, revise, keep integrating the knowledge. Having the Prac content, and supporting Wikis, etc, set 
out in the form of beautifully-structured, indexed GitHub 
content is a really generous, smart, way to support students in that. Thanks. :-)
